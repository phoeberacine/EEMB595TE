## Objectives

(1) To learn what is Git, Github, GitDesktop, and Rstudio

(2) To learn how to use version control

(3) To learn how to obtain class materials using the terminal

## Before starting

Before starting this tutorital, you will need to download several pieces of software:

- RStudio

      https://www.rstudio.com/
      
- Git

      https://git-scm.com/downloads
      
- GitDesktop

      https://desktop.github.com/

As well as create a Github account:

- Github

      http://github.com

- Note that you can eligible for unlimited private repositories as a student on Github (with a standard account you only get 5 private repositories):

      https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new

te that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#### Why Github?
- Version control
  
    - Keeps track of deletions/additions to code
    
    - Shows changes that collaboratos have made
    
    - Have 1 file rather than 20 with different names, date, and version numbers 

- Good workflow with collaborators
    
    - One location for:
        
        - Code
        
        - Collaborator discussions

- Reproducible and transparent methods and results

    - You can post PDFs, code, and data all in a single location for others to 

#### Course Materials 

To access the course materials you must be able to interact with GitHub and must install our course-specific ``R`` package ``SESYNCBayes``. After completing the initial install of these materials, plan on updating throughout the course as add new content or tweak pre-existing material.  Instructions for the initial setup and ongoing updates are below.

A quick note about GitHub: at the heart of GitHub is an open source version control system (VCS) called Git. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer. There are a few things that you will need to do to get going with git/GitHub.  Mainly, you must create free a GitHub account and get your machine ready to interact with your account.
