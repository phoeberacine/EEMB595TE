### Course work

This course will be broken up into two phases:

(1) First, we will go over the basics in performing Bayesian analyses and run through code together

(2) Then, as either individuals or group, students will present on:

  - A topic we did not cover in class
  - Analyze their data in a way we learned
  - Analyze their data in a way we did not learn in class

For a single person presenting, the time allotted is: 10 minutes

For each additional person in the group add 10 minutes.
